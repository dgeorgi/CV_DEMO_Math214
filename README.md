# CV_DEMO_Math214

The demos and associated files needed for our math214 final project.

## How to Use

To effectively utilize the demos in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Python Files and Source Image:** Ensure you have all the necessary files downloaded from the repository.

2. **Running the Demos:**
   - Open a terminal on your computer.
   - Navigate to the directory where you have saved the downloaded files.

   For general usage, type the following command:

python3 [path/to/python_file]

Replace `[path/to/python_file]` with the actual path to the Python file you wish to run.

If you are running a demo that requires an image (e.g., the first demo), use this command:

**Example:**
python3 [path/to/demo_1] [path/to/image]
Here, replace `[path/to/demo_1]` with the path to the demo file and `[path/to/image]` with the path to the required image file.
